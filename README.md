### Why
I created this project to see if we can actually understand the musical patterns of a listener with their playlist as source and what factors are really useful in determining the taste and interest of the listener.

1. Clone the repo 

   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/Sarathisme/music-recommendation-system.git
   ````


### Run it
Unfortunately at this point we do not have a .tar or a pickle file for you to quickly plug and play the code.

1. Go to the cloned folder

   ```shell
   $ cd path-to-code
   ```
2. Run setup.py to get the dataset installed and extracted into the project folder.
   
   ```shell
   $ python setup.py
   ```

3. Open jupyter notebook

4. Open `Music Recommendation System (Data Processing and Analysis).ipynb` for data processing and analysis
